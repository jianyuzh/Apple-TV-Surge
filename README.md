Proxy for Apple TV

This is the first time I choose configuration files to express the proxy on an Apple TV.
Compare with the normal http proxy through the side router, this one make the computer can be powered off and only use one iPod can do that.

1/6, the first try has been failed.
I will try global http proxy next day.
